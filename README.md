# Extracting-Syllabus-of-all-Tutorails-from-Tutorials-Point-
In this project I have used python to scrap website. I have taken Tutorials Point website and scraped it extracting the syllabus of all the different types of Tutorials offered by the Website and saved it into different text file.

I have used Urllib and BeautifulSoup libraries to open and parse the website respectively. I have saved the data extracted in a text file.

The files containing the extracted data can be found at the link below -
